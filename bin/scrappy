  Quotes = """Knowledge talks, wisdom listens
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me
Only the wisest and the stupidest of men never change
Don’t let your victories go to your head, or your failures go to your heart
Those who criticize our generation forget who raised it
Criticizing is easy, art is difficult
I don’t know what the key to success is, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone
When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends
Not to care for philosophy is to be a true philosopher
The mind is like a parachute. It doesn’t work unless it’s open
The best mind-altering drug is truth
Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so
Never forget what a man says to you when he is angry
A winner listens, a loser just waits until it is their turn to talk
Guns don’t kill people — people do
He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened
If you are not part of the cure, then you are part of the problem
The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them
The best things in life are not things
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest
You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him
Think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought
He who knows others is learned; he who knows himself is wise
Going to church doesn’t make you a Christian, anymore than standing in your garage makes you a car
Never challenge an old man, because if you lose, you’ve lost to an old man, and if you win, so what?
Half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have spent most of life trying to save
He who indulges in a task without proper knowledge will deteriorate rather than improve the case
It is because of it’s emptiness that the cup is useful
When the people of the world all know beauty as beauty, there arises the recognition of ugliness
The apprentice who tries to take the carpenters place, always cuts his hands
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends
A wise man’s actions speak for himself
Never wrestle with a pig -- you both get dirty, but the pig likes it
50% of the solution is to put your hands on the problem
Never keep your head down, you’re better than many
Those who fail to prepare, are preparing to fail
The man who smiles when things go wrong has thought of someone to blame it on
Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils
It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives
Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway
The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not
I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying
Dogs have owners, cats have staff
I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works
It is better to be beautiful than to be good, but it is better to be good than to be ugly
All human beings, by nature, desire to know
All life is an experiment
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest
An optimist is a person who sees a green light everywhere. The pessimist sees only the red light. But the truly wise person is color blind
Chance favors only those who court her
Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man how to fish, he'll eat for a lifetime
God helps them that help themselves
Great beginnings are not as important as the way one finishes
Happiness is not a reward - it is consequence. Suffering is not a punishment - it is a result
Don't think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday
Maturity is achieved when a person postpones immediate pleasures for long-term values
Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity for experience
Much wisdom often goes with fewer words
Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today
Never mistake knowledge for wisdom. One helps you make a living; the other helps you make a life
Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely
It requires wisdom to understand wisdom: the music is nothing if the audience is deaf
It takes a great deal of living to get a little deal of learning
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever
Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow
What you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple. Whether you are willing to do it is another matter
When written in Chinese the word crisis is composed to two characters. One represents danger, and the other represents opportunity
Cheer up, the worst is yet to come
Common sense ain't common
A coward is a hero with a wife, kids, and a mortgage
All power corrupts, but we need electricity
Do not try to live forever. You will not succeed
Pick the flower when it is ready to be picked
The greatest risk is the risk of riskless living
The man who does things makes many mistakes, but he never makes the biggest mistake of all - doing nothing
The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything
The results you achieve will be in direct proportion to the effort you apply
The reward of a thing well done is to have done it
Don’t argue with idiots. They will bring you down to their level and beat you with experience""".split("\n")
